# Final-project
# Children with autism often struggle with social skills such as recognizing the emotions of people around them or taking turns. This can make it difficult for them to connect with peers, friends, and even their family members.
To help with this issue, a simple and visual game has been designed. Games are both entertaining, which motivates children to play, and they also make learning easier.
In the first part, the child needs to recognize facial emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised). This gradually helps them identify emotions more easily in real-life situations.
In the second part, through a turn-taking game (popping bubbles), the child learns to wait patiently, respect othersâ€™ turns, and follow rules.
Over time, by practicing in the game, the child develops skills such as understanding othersâ€™ emotions, which are often reactions to their own actions, as well as patience, turn-taking, and rule-following. These skills can later help them in social interactions and daily life, making it easier to live in a world that may feel very different from the inner world they experience. ðŸŒ±
